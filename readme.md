check the 20296cf commit comments, also copied in below, we need some SuperSet of HTML;  just like, TypeScript-to-JavaScript :


Fixing the BUG (onClick function name in start-component.html  was mis-typed in  onclick)  (there were no ways to CHECK this typo in development.   Yeah, TypeScript checks JavaScript types; but we also need similar checks for HTML or any other TEMPLATEs) ...  

The error messages from Angular2 in RunTime ,  not help that much, the star-component information was so burried in all those Angular2 printouts ....     We can find all these, because of SMALL # of files changes.

If there were many files changed at one time, by several people, how to catch such errors (typos in html or templates) quickly?
